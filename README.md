GachAni (Gacha Anime) is an anime recommendation site, power by user reviews and recomendations on [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net). It provides recommendations by way of displaying top rated Anime (by users on MAL), as well as allowing the user to search for recommended anime based on their favorites.

I created this after working on a Go library for the MAL API as a way to flush out functionality. I also thought it would be neat to find recommendations without having to slog through MAL's website every time.
